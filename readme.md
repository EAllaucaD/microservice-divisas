    Efficiency: Automates the currency conversion process, eliminating the need for repetitive manual calculations.
    Accuracy: Uses an updated API to ensure accurate and reliable exchange rates.
    Portability: Encapsulation in Docker ensures that the program runs consistently on various systems and platforms.

This project offers a robust and easy to implement solution for any application requiring automated currency conversion functionalities.
